# USDA-ARS Geospatial Common Data Library (GeoCDL) - R package

This package is an optional interface for the GeoCDL web API running on the 
SCINet Ceres cluster. 
Please see 
[https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/gcdl](https://github.com/USDA-SCINet/gcdl) 
for the web API itself.

## Getting started

The development version can be installed on Ceres with:

```r
devtools::install_github('USDA-SCINet/rgeocdl')
```

When a stable release is made, we will have the VRSC install that version of the 
R package in the site library accessible to everyone. To learn more about 
installing R packages on Ceres, see 
[this guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guide/packageinstall/#installing-r-packages).
